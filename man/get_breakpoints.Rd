\title{Calculate Jenks Breakpoints for Social Network Data}
\usage{
get_breakpoints(social_networks, break_num = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{social_networks}{A 3D array with dimensions \link{individuals, individuals, time points}.}

\item{break_num}{The number of breaks (clusters) to compute. Default is 3.}
}
\value{
A matrix containing the ID, time point, and Jenks breakpoints for each individual-time combination.
}
\description{
This function computes Jenks natural breakpoints for social network data across individuals and time points.
The result is a matrix containing breakpoints for each individual at each time point.
}
\examples{
# Example usage:
# Assuming 'social_network_data' is a 3D array with dimensions [individuals, individuals, time]
breakpoints <- get_breakpoints(social_network_data, break_num = 3)
print(breakpoints)
}
