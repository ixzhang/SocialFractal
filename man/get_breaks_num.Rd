\title{Find the appropriate number of breaks using Jenks natural breaks optimization}
\usage{
get_breaks_num(social_networks, max_breaks = 5)
}
\arguments{
\item{social_networks}{A 3D array containing social network data over time.
Dimensions are individuals (first/second dimension), and time points (third dimension).}

\item{max_breaks}{The maximum number of breaks to consider. Default is 5.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the GVF values for different numbers of breaks across individuals and time points.
}
\description{
This function optimizes the number of breaks for a given dataset using the Jenks natural breaks algorithm.
It iterates over different numbers of breaks and calculates the Goodness of Variance Fit (GVF) for each combination of individual and time point.
The GVF metric helps determine the number of breaks that best represents the data structure while minimizing variance within groups.

# Example usage:
# Assuming 'social_network_data' is a 3D array with dimensions [individuals, individuals, time]
result <- get_breaks_num(social_network_data, max_breaks = 5)
# Explore the results to determine the optimal number of breaks
