\title{Calculate Clumping Rate in Social Networks in Null Model 1}
\usage{
clumping_rate_null1(data, individuals, threshold)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data.frame containing spatial coordinates and time information.
Columns: id, x, y, time.}

\item{individuals}{A vector of unique individual identifiers.}

\item{threshold}{The spatial threshold (in the units of x and y) to
determine close contacts.}
}
\value{
A matrix representing the clumping rate between individuals.
}
\description{
This function calculates the clumping rate in a social network based on
spatial proximity over time, tests for major social preferences by
permuting the identities of individuals on the same perch at the same time.
The clumping rate is defined as the ratio of interactions within a given
threshold to the total number of interactions.

\examples{
# Example usage:
# Assuming 'spatial_data' is a data.frame with columns 'id', 'x', 'y', 'time'
# data(raw_data)
# data(zf_ind)
# cr_matrix <- clumping_rate(raw_data,
# individuals = zf_ind$Ind_ID[zf_ind$Replicate == 1],
# threshold = 75)
# print(cr_matrix)
